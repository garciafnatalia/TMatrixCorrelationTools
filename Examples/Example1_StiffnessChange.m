%INTERPRETATION:
%  - T_Mass_Matrix values equal to 90Â° indicate perfect mass correlation. 
%  - T_Stiffness_Matrix detects stiffness discrepancies. Note that 
%    T_Stiffness_Matrix1 is more sensitive to stiffness changes but also to 
%    identification errors in the mode shapes.
%  - MAC values show slight discrepancies due to rotations. ROTMAC displays 
%    diagonal values equal to 1, which confirms the absence of shear (as 
%    expected when there are only stiffness changes).
%  - Similar results are expected in the case of closely-spaced modes, 
%    since in the case of stiffness discrepancies only rotational effects 
%    appear, and shear effects are absent.
